# partyinviteproject
This is a web app: Imagine that a friend has decided to host a party and has asked you to create a web app that allows invites to electronically RSVP. The invite is to provide for the following features:

1. A home page that shows information about the party. 
2. A form that can be used to RSVP. 
3. Validation for the RSVP form, which will display a thank-you page. 
4. A summary page that shows who is coming to the party.
